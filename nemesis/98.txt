taht over the decades the neighboorhood kids had
pried loose for missiles to fling murderously at the alley cats or larkily at a passing car or in anger at
one another. Girls in the building played hopscotch there until the boys drove them out to play aces up; there was the jumble of the building's beat-up metal
garbage cans; and crisscrossing overhead were the clotheslines, a drooping web of them, rope strung on pulleys from a rear window in each tenement flat to a weathered telephone pole at the far side of the dilapidated yard. During earliest childhood,
whenever his grandmother leaned out of the window to hang the week's wash, he stood nearby passing her the clothespins. Sometimes he would wake up screaming from nightmares of her leaning so far over the sill to hang a bedsheet that she tu,bled out the third story-wimdow. Before his grandparents determined how and when to make intelligible
to 
him that 
his mother had 
died in childbirth, 
he had come to imagine
that she had died in just such
a fall of her own. That's  what having a backyard had meant
to him until he was old enough to comprehend and deal with the
truth--a place of death, small rectangular graveyard for the women who loved him.
